  Nice crate which uses a build script to auto-generate the character
  tables at compile time. Has one instance of `unsafe` where a `u8` is
  cast to an enum. The enum is marked as `repr(u8)` to make this safe.

  Nice crate with no unsafe code (uses `deny(unsafe_code)` to ensure
  this). The data tables are generated automatically from the upstream
  Unicode data using a Python script, which ensures that theyâ€™re
  correct and easy to update when new Unicode versions are published.

  Standard and well-tested RNG. Has one instance of unsafe, which
  seems safe to me.

  No unsafe code, has tests and references to the original
  implementation.
